## Jupycard:

To use Jupycard, it's very simple. You can:

1. **Download the file** and open it where suits you best: like Google Colab, Jupyter, VS Code and others;

2. **[Go directly](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15n4szAatgZnPKI4pAdXCmKEUJBiQp1Uk?usp=sharing)** to the file on Google Colab*;

3. **Fork this repository** and alter the file directly anywhere you want (such as in Colab or VS Code).

*: *For option 2, you will have to make your personal copy of the flashcard, so you can use it freely.*
